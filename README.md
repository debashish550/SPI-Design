# SPI-Design
Project Title: "FPGA-Based Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Design in Verilog with Xilinx Vivado Simulation"
Description:
Develop an SPI module in Verilog for FPGA applications to facilitate synchronous serial communication.
Utilize Xilinx Vivado for in-depth simulation and verification of the SPI module's operation, ensuring its suitability for integration into FPGA-based systems.
